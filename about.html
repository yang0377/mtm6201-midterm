            <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1>
            <p>I grow up on a ranch where I went horseback riding from a young age and developed a deep familiarity with animals. My entire family has been involved in the pet clinic industry. My father, uncle, and grandfather all owned their own businesses and I have many happy memories in their veterinary clinics.</p>
            <p>I pursued this passion by studying veterinary for years in my home country, and I am now eager to bring my expertise and love for animals to Ottawa.</p>
